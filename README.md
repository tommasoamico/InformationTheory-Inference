# InformationTheory-Inference
Repository for the course of Information Theory and Inference of the UniPD Physics of Data master's degree.

What will be uploaded here are the assigments and the final project of the Michele Allegra Information theory course. In the assigment the following topics are covered,

- Compute the entropy of a Shakespeare play's act

<br/>

- Given 8 probabilityes and their probability mass function find,
  * What is the information content of each outcome $x_i$?

  * What is the entropy of the distribution?

  * Draw a binary probability tree for X. For each node, write the corresponding envent; 
  for each edge, write the corresponding conditional probability
  * Plot the essential bit content $H_{\delta}(X)$ as a function of the error $\delta$
